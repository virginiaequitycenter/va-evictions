The [Virginia Evictors Catalog](https://virginiaequitycenter.shinyapps.io/va-evictors-catalog/) provides data on plaintiffs filing unlawful detainers (evictions) in Virginia's General District Courts.

This repository contains code for cleaning and standardizing case data and for building the app. Raw case data are provided by the non-profit [Legal Services Corporation](https://www.lsc.gov/). (An earlier version of this app used data gathered by [Ben Schoenfeld](https://github.com/bschoenfeld).)

An overview of the data-cleaning and standardization process is on the app's [_Data Notes_ page](https://virginiaequitycenter.shinyapps.io/va-evictors-catalog/). The process draws heavily on the [ECtools](https://github.com/virginiaequitycenter/ECtools) package, developed by UVA Library Research Data Services and The Equity Center.

The case records comprising the data reflected in the app are public; however, to protect defendants from being named against their will or wishes, we do not currently include the raw data in this repository.
