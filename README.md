The [Virginia Evictors Catalog](https://virginiaequitycenter.shinyapps.io/va-evictors-catalog/) provides data on plaintiffs filing unlawful detainers (evictions) in Virginia's General District Courts.

This repository contains code for cleaning, standardizing, and aggregating case data and for building the app. Raw case data are provided by the non-profit [Legal Services Corporation](https://www.lsc.gov/). (An earlier version of this app used data gathered by [Ben Schoenfeld](https://github.com/bschoenfeld).)

Details about the data cleaning and standardization process are in the expandable section below. The process draws heavily on the [ECtools](https://github.com/virginiaequitycenter/ECtools) package, developed by UVA Library Research Data Services and The Equity Center.

<details><summary>Data cleaning and standardization process</summary><br/>
Case data are provided periodically by the Legal Services Corporation. Data on plaintiffs, defendants, hearings, etc. are provided separately; we aggregate all the data for a given case and identify a "primary" plaintiff name, plaintiff address, defendant name, and defendant address for each case based on the <em>first-listed</em> plaintiff/defendant in each court record. We perform this step because many cases have multiple plaintiffs and/or defendants listed.<br><br>

Names in the case data have both formatting inconsistencies and errors. If left unaddressed, these would radically hamper our ability to identify multiple cases filed by the same defendant (e.g., "ABC REAL ESTATE, LLC" and "ABC REAL-ESTATE LLC" would be treated as separate plaintiffs). Plaintiff names are cleaned and standardized by the Legal Services Corporation using their <a href="https://pypi.org/project/cleancourt/" target="_blank">CleanCourt</a> Python library; standardization of defendant names and other data-cleaning processes are implemented using the <a href="https://github.com/virginiaequitycenter/ECtools" target="_blank">ECtools</a> package built by UVA Library StatLab. For plaintiff names, the Legal Services Corporation identifies probable misspellings/alternative spellings of the same entity using term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency and cosine similarity measures to reduce a set of messy plaintiff names a cleaned set (e.g., identifying "ABC ENTERPRISES" and "ABC ENTERPRESES" as the same entity and labelling them both as "ABC ENTERPRISES").

With cleaned and standardized names in hand, we then remove duplicate records by identifying cases that have the same filing date, plaintiff name, defendant name, defendant ZIP Code, judgment (outcome), judgment costs, attorney fees, and principal/other amounts. (We retain one record for each set of duplicate case.)

We then identify "serial cases," which we consider to be repeated cases filed by a given plaintiff against a given defendant in a given ZIP Code within a 12-month period.

We then identify and filter out _non-residential_ defendants by using a custom-developed regex pattern, as we display results in the app for cases against residential defendants only. You can view full regex pattern [here](https://github.com/jacob-gg/non-person-regex).

Cleaned data are then exported and aggregated up to the level of plaintiff, plaintiff/year, and plaintiff/month, which are the levels of summarization available for viewing in the app.

Code for the data cleaning and standardization process is in `clean.R`; code for aggregating cleaned data is in `summarize.R`; code for the app is in the `va-evictors-catalog` directory (see `app.R`).

The case records comprising the data reflected in the app are public; however, to protect defendants from being named against their will or wishes, we do not currently include the raw case data in this repository.
