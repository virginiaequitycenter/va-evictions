<h1>Data Notes</h1>

<h2>Data Source</h2>

<p>The data on eviction filings are taken from Virginia's <a href="https://eapps.courts.state.va.us/gdcourts/landing.do?landing=landing">General District Court Online Case Information System</a> and represent all unlawful detainer (eviction) cases filed in the state's Civil Courts. Data are provided by the Civil Court Data Initiative (<a href="https://www.lsc.gov/initiatives/civil-court-data-initiative">CCDI</a>) through a partnership with <a href="https://www.lsc.gov/" target="_blank">Legal Services Corporation</a>.</p>

<p>The data presented here includes only eviction cases filed against <em>residential</em> defendants (tenants); cases filed against commercial tenants have been removed. In addition, the data here is organized around eviction filers; tenants who are defendants in eviction cases are not identified.</p>


<h2>Variable Definitions</h2>
<p>Each row in the database represents an evictor â€” the plaintiff filing the eviction case. For each evictor, the data reports: </p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Court Jurisdiction:</b> The general district court where the case was filed. Court jurisdictions are tied to localities (counties or cities) in Virginia. There are general district courts in every county and city, though some city/county areas share a court jurisdiction.</li>
  <li><b>Plaintiff Name:</b> The entity filing an eviction case against a tenant with the court. In Virginia, eviction cases can be filed by "the landlord, [their] agent, attorney, or other person" (<a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title8.01/chapter3/section8.01-126/" target="_blank">&sect;8.01-126</a>). Within the Virginia Evictors Catalog, the plaintiff is the evictor of record.</li>
  <li><b>Cases Filed:</b> The total number of eviction cases filed by the plaintiff in the selected time period and jurisdiction.</li>
  <li><b>Eviction Judgments:</b> The total number of cases filed by the plaintiff that ended in a judgment of eviction (a judgment for the plaintiff). Eviction cases may end in a judgment for the plaintiff (eviction), a judgment for the defendant, a dismissal, or the judgment may be pending.<sup>1</sup> Consequently, the filings may include cases that are still open or that are concluded without a judgment.</li>
  <li><b>Serial Filings:</b> We consider serial cases to be repeated cases filed by a given plaintiff against a given defendant in a given ZIP code within a 12-month period.</li>
  <li><b>Time Frame:</b> The data on evictors can be viewed as total filings and evictions for the full time period (all years), by year, or by month across the full time period.</li>
  <li><b>Known Virginia Defendant ZIP Codes:</b> The ZIP codes provided for the defendants (tenants) against whom the unlawful detainer/eviction is filed. The Online Case Information System does not provide full addresses of plaintiffs or defendants, only ZIP codes. ZIP codes of defendants are provided here to better understand <b>where</b> evictors are filing cases. Defendant ZIP codes are not repeated, so if an evictor filed four cases against defendants in ZIP 12345, 12345 would only be listed once. Not all cases provide valid ZIP codes or ZIP codes within Virginia; these have been removed from the current catalog.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Data Processing</h2>
<p>We have applied several cleaning procedures to improve data quality, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Removing duplicate case records.</li>
    <li>Standardizing plaintiff and defendant names. <em>Note: Plaintiff names are standardized by the Legal Services Corporation using their <a href="https://pypi.org/project/cleancourt/" target="_blank">CleanCourt</a> Python library; standardization of defendant names and other data-cleaning processes are implemented using the <a href="https://github.com/virginiaequitycenter/ECtools" target="_blank">ECtools</a> R package built by UVA Library StatLab</em>.</li>
    <ul>
    <li>For example:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>A court clerk might record a name as "FRESH FRUIT L.L.C." on Monday and as "FRESH FRUIT LLC" on Tuesday, so miscellaneous punctuation marks are trimmed from names.</li>
        <li>A name might be listed as "GOOD LIVING APTS" in one case and as "GOOD LIVING APARTMENTS" in another, so names are standardized to only use one form of commonly abbreviated housing terms (APTS/APARTMENTS; MGMT/MANAGEMENT; etc.).</li>
        <li>You can read more in the <em>Data cleaning and standardization process</em> section <a href="https://github.com/virginiaequitycenter/va-evictions" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  <li>Identifying residential defendants using a custom-developed regex pattern and filtering out all non-residential defendants. You can view the full regex <a href="https://github.com/jacob-gg/non-person-regex" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Legal Services Corporation identifies probable misspellings/alternative spellings of the same plaintiff across court records using language processing methods (e.g., identifying "ABC ENTERPRISES" and "ABC ENTERPRESES" as the same entity and labelling them both as "ABC ENTERPRISES"). However, as a given evictor/plaintiff name may contain many variations, alternative spellings, misspellings, and abbreviations across multiple eviction filings, the same evictor may still appear in multiple rows with only slight differences in the names. Users interested in a particular landlord or evictor should consider doing searches of partial names in the Plaintiff Name column.</p>

<p>We are currently investigating additional approaches to deduplicate and standardize plaintiff names, including matching alternative spellings based on a list of all observed variants of a name to generate a common name. Manually creating a list of matches is labor intensive and has been explored for only a handful of localities.</li>

<p>The code repository for this work is available on <a href="https://github.com/virginiaequitycenter/va-evictions" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

<li>Less common outcomes include the defendant is not found or not served a summons, the case is transferred to another venue, the case is appealed, and "other" judgments.</li>
