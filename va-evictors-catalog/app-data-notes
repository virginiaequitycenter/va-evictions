<h1>Data Notes</h1>

<div class="page-description">
The Virginia Evictors Catalog provides data about plaintiffs filing unlawful detainers (evictions) in Virginia's General District Courts from January 2018 through September 2022.
</div>

<h2>Data Source</h2>

<p>The data on eviction filings are taken from Virginia's <a href="https://eapps.courts.state.va.us/gdcourts/landing.do?landing=landing">General District Court Online Case Information System</a> and represent all unlawful detainer (eviction) cases filed in the state's Civil Courts.</p>

<p>Data from 2018 through 2021 were provided by Ben Schoenfeld as part of his <a href="https://virginiacourtdata.org/" target="_blank">Virginia Court Data Project</a>. Data from 2022 on are provided by the Civil Court Data Initiative (<a href="https://www.lsc.gov/initiatives/civil-court-data-initiative">CCDI</a>) through a partnership with <a href="https://www.lsc.gov/" target="_blank">Legal Services Corporation's</a>.</p>

<p>The data presented here includes only eviction cases filed against <em>residential</em> defendants (tenants); cases filed against commercial tenants have been removed. In addition, the data here is organized around eviction filers; tenants who are defendants in eviction cases are not identified.</p>


<h2>Variable Definitions</h2>
<p>Each row in the database represents an evictor -- the plaintiff filing the eviction case. For each evictor, the data reports: </p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Court Jurisdiction:</b> The general district court where the case was filed. Court jurisdictions are tied to localities (counties or cities) in Virginia. There are general district courts in every county and city, though some city/county areas share a court jurisdiction.</li>
  <li><b>Plaintiff Name:</b> The entity filing an eviction case against a tenant with the court. In Virginia, eviction cases can be filed by "the landlord, his agent, attorney, or other person" (<a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title8.01/chapter3/section8.01-126/" target="_blank">&sect;8.01-126</a>). Within the Virginia Evictors Catalog, the plaintiff is the evictor of record.</li>
  <li><b>Filings:</b> The total number of eviction cases filed by the plaintiff in the selected time period. </li>
  <li><b>Evictions:</b> The total number of cases filed by the plaintiff that ended in a judgment of eviction (a judgment for the plaintiff). Eviction cases may end in a judgment for the plaintiff (eviction), a judgment for the defendant, a dismissal, or the judgment may be pending.^[Less common outcomes include the defendant is not found or not served a summons, the case is transferred to another venue, the case is appealed, and "other" judgments.] Consequently, the filings may include cases that are still open or that are concluded without a judgment.</li>
  <li><b>Time Frame:</b> The data on evictors can be viewed as total filings and evictions for the full time period (all years), by year, or by month across the full time period.</li>
  <li><b>Defendant ZIP Codes:</b> The zip codes provided for the defendants (tenants) against whom the unlawful detainer/eviction is filed. The Online Case Information System does not provide full addresses of plaintiffs or defendants, only zip codes. ZIP codes of defendants are provided here to better understand *where* evictors are filing cases. Defendant ZIP Codes are not repeated, so if an evictor filed four cases against defendants in ZIP 12345, 12345 would only be listed once. Not all cases provide valid ZIP codes or ZIP codes within Virginia. These are represented as NA.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Data Processing</h2>
<p>We have applied several cleaning procedures to improve data quality, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Removing duplicate case records</li>

    <li>Standardizing plaintiff and defendant names; for example:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>A court clerk might record a name as "FRESH FRUIT LLC" on Monday and as "FRESH FRUIT, LLC" on Tuesday, so we eliminate commas before business-identifying acronyms (LLC, LP, LLP, etc.)</li>
        <li>A plaintiff might be listed as "GOOD LIVING APTS" in one case and as "GOOD LIVING APARTMENTS" in another, so we expand common housing acronyms (APTS&#8594;APARTMENTS; MGMT&#8594;MANAGEMENT, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
  <li>Identifying residential defendants using an internally-developed regex pattern and filtering out all non-residential defendants. You can view the full regex list <a href="https://github.com/jacob-gg/non-person-regex" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>A given evictor/plaintiff name may contain many variations, alternative spellings, mispellings, and abbreviations across multiple eviction filings. As a consequence, the same evictor may appear in multiple rows with only slight differences in the names. Users interested in a particular landlord or evictor should consider doing searches of partial names in the Plaintiff Name column.</p> 

<p>We are currently investigating approaches to deduplicate plaintiff names, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>"Defuzzing" plaintiff names in order to reduce the number of alternative spellings/misspellings of the same name, which would otherwise reduce the accuracy of this database. We've explored using string-distance algorithms to identify likely "fuzzy matches" between plaintiff names with slight spelling differences that share the same court of filing. This computationally intensive process has not yet been completed for all localities.</li>
  <li>Matching from a list of all observed variants of a name to generate a common name. This labor intensive approach has been explored for only a handful of localities.</li>
  </ul>
